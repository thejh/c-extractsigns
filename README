compiling:

    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    make

usage:

    $ ./extractsigns ~/software/minecraft-server/world/region
    found a sign at (-282|64|185)
    ABCDEFGHIJKLMNO
    012345678901234
    abcdefghijklmno
    qwertzuiopqwert
    
If there are more signs, all of them will be printed, with empty lines as seperators.

Instead of `region`, use `DIM1` for The End and `DIM-1` for the nether.
